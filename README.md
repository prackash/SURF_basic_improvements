# SURF_basic_improvements
Improvements to existing SURF algorithm using basic and usual filters and trial and error to find changes in the images .

In the attached code we can see that when we sharpen the image in the test it results in greater number of keypoints which in turn means that there are more points to compare whereas in contrast if we apply blur on the image it decreases the keypoints which yeilds lesser comparison 

So it can be said that sharpen the teest image before comparing would be better
